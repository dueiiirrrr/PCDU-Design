# Power Conditioning and Distribution Unit (PCDU)

This project focuses on the design and simulation of a low-voltage DC Power Conditioning and Distribution Unit (PCDU).
The system conditions an input DC supply, distributes power to multiple loads, and provides basic electrical protection to ensure safe operation.
The project is developed as a learning-oriented electrical engineering project, emphasizing fundamentals rather than complex or mission-critical applications.

# Objectives
To understand power conditioning in DC systems.
To design a simple power distribution architecture.
To implement basic protection mechanisms.
To model and analyze the system using GNU Octave.
