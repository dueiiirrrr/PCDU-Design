# Power Conditioning and Distribution Unit (PCDU)

This repository documents the design and analysis of a Power Conditioning and Distribution Unit (PCDU) intended for a CubeSat-class spacecraft.

## Objectives
- Regulate and distribute power from solar panels and batteries
- Protect subsystems from over-voltage, under-voltage, and over-current
- Provide reliable power buses for payload and onboard electronics

## Scope
- Conceptual system architecture
- Battery and bus modeling
- Protection logic and safe-mode concepts
- Software-based simulations (GNU Octave / MATLAB)

## Tools Used
- Block diagram modeling

## Current Status
- Stage 1: System architecture and power flow definition (in progress)
